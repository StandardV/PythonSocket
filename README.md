## Development planning

  This script is still in the working phase so please pardon me of any mistake that I made.
  
  It is intended to work as a Virtual assistance on a Raspberry pi that will connect all household electronic, mainly the work computer. 
  
  It will have the abilities to:
    * Using Wake-On-Lan to send package from RP to wake the connected computer up from sleep mode
    * Any other Virtual Asistance feature, can answer time, say good morning, econ information...etc...
    * Able to Connect to few pre-defined client from WAN through socket, client can send command to raspberry pi and ask for it to do specific work, include Wake-On-Lan and control work computer via cmd
